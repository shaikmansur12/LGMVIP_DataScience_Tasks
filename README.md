## Task 1 - Iris Classification ML Project
The Iris Flower Dataset Contains Numeric Attributes, And It Is Perfect For Beginners To Learn Supervised ML Algorithms.

## Task 2 - Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting using Stacked LSTM
LSTM Is A Type Of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) That Can Effectively Capture Temporal Dependencies And Patterns In Sequential Data. 

The Stock Market Is Known For Its Complex And Volatile Nature, Making Accurate Predictions Challenging. However, Stacked LSTM Models Have Shown Promise In Capturing The Underlying Trends And Patterns In Historical Stock Data, Enabling The Prediction Of Future Price Movements.

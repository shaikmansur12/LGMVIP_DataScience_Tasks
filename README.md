## Task 2 - Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting using Stacked LSTM
LSTM Is A Type Of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) That Can Effectively Capture Temporal Dependencies And Patterns In Sequential Data. 
The Stock Market Is Known For Its Complex And Volatile Nature, Making Accurate Predictions Challenging. However, Stacked LSTM Models Have Shown Promise In Capturing The Underlying Trends And Patterns In Historical Stock Data, Enabling The Prediction Of Future Price Movements.

## Task 4 - Image To Pencil Sketch
We Need To Read The Image In RBG Format And Then Convert It To A GraySacle Image. This Will Turn An Image Into A Classic Black And White Photo. Then The Next Thing To Do Is Invert The GrayScale Image. Then We Can Finally Create The Pencil Sketch By Using The CV2 Library In Python 

## Task 6 - Prediction Using Decision Tree Classification
Decision tree algorithms are commonly used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. They make predictions by creating a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
